Introduction : 
	Dungeon under the Labyrinth

After awaken into an unknown place u vaguely have a call black of a woman shrouded in mystery calling upon you , laid flat on your back, she caress your hair as she tells you something but it was hard to hear due to your tired state but you could only decipher little and is as follows "don't... again... (Gender)". And such you shake your head look around and find you are located in a confine space nothing really there just a empty space with the exception of some rats...

-> insert into introduction to movement

After going a little around the area you seemingly find a broken statue of a dog... with this revelation a voice would call out "you're awake?" (-insert response) "you should go further the right path to find me." (-insert response) "I shall be waiting for you... if you are still alive that is... haha..." (-insert response)

-> player go further down a path
- Left door of the labyrinth would lead into a room of a caterpillar speaks only on riddles and berates and belittle the player through his riddles
- If you enter the left door with Alicia go to pt.2
- Right Door of the labyrinth would lead the player into a room with someone unconscious as player tries to wake the sleeping maiden she awoke and screams

= Right Door
"AAAAHHHHHHH* how are you??? and where am I? did you kidnap me?" as she screams she franticly moves backwards towards the wall and as she hits her head she shouted "KEEP YOUR DISTANCE FROM ME DIDDLER!!" (-player response) as you look at her scared face you noticed that she is somewhat similar to a certain character in a children book but you can't seem to remember the title of the book but with her, black bow and elegant blue with white dress, it is undeniable...
"what are you looking at?" she seem to have kept her guard up from you looking at her... (-player response) "I'll calm down but who are you first? and where are we?" (-player response) "okay okay i believe you but we need to get out of here or my mother would chop my head off if i skip another study lesson" as she frown in the thought of her mother. (-player response)

= Left Door (pt. 1)
you are welcomed with a smoky air that surrounded the room, player cough's, in the far corner of the room you spot a dark figure and as you grow closer it notices you, exhaling a ring like smoke and says. "And who, pray tell, is this insignificant speck disturbing my contemplation? State your purpose, if you even possess one." (-player response) { can you stop smoking your covering the room | Just exploring, and I couldn't help but notice your... interesting hobby | well... I'm [player name] do you know where the library is?}. The caterpillar takes another slow puff, eyes barely slits, a wisp of smoke curling like a question mark "Lost? Or merely lacking the wit to find your own path? A common affliction, I find, among those who wander without a thought."  (-player response)
{so the library? | are you gonna stop smoking for a sec? | I can't handle this anymore I'm leaving.} His eyes finally open fully, fixing on you with an intense, condescending gaze "Which way? As if your minuscule choices matter in the grand tapestry. The path reveals itself only to those who have eyes to see beyond their own nose. If you do not care where you arrive, then any road will lead you to the same oblivion, won't it? so leave now." Player can roam around.

= Left Door (pt.2)
you are welcomed with a smoky air that surrounded the room, player and Alicia cough's and cover their mouths as Alicia points out a dark figure in the distance and calls out, "Is that you Absolem?"
and the caterpillar grows near to you exhaling smoke ring in front of the party "Ah, the familiar flicker in the periphery. And what nameless, formless echo have you dragged into my realm of quiet contemplation, little Alice? Speak, if this... thing... possesses a voice." Alicia sighs and says "We are looking for a place called the library, any idea where it is?" Absolem response A 'library,' you say?" He exhales a slow, perfectly formed smoke square, which then wobbles and dissolves. "How quaint. Do you seek mere paper whispers bound in leather, or the boundless tales whispered by the wind through the mushroom caps? Here, knowledge isn't shelved; it simply... _is_. Perhaps you're looking for a place that exists only in the narrow confines of your own imagination, little one. Tell me, can you truly read the story etched into a falling leaf?" (-player response) { Enough with your cryptic nonsense! We asked for directions, not a lecture on the 'boundless tales of the wind'! If you're not going to help, then just say so, and we'll be on our way! | Read a leaf? What in Wonderland are you talking about? We're looking for a building, a place with actual books! Are you saying it doesn't exist, or that you're just... playing games? | Alright, if all you offer are riddles and condescension, then we've clearly wasted enough time here. We'll find the library ourselves. Farewell. } caterpillar inhales a big smoke and exhale a big smoke then went into the shadow and said "you figure things out then..." Player can roam around.
